# FEDERATED CUBESAT SYSTEM

[CPS Framework](https://pages.nist.gov/cpspwg/)

It is a COLLABORATIVE SoS -- comprise constituent systems which voluntarily choos eto participate to fulfill some central purposes, which can evolve based on collaboration between constitutents and SoS. There is no overall  directing authority. Constituent systems adhere to standards and regulations but can negotiate individually to evolve roles and working practices. (INCOSE SoS Primer)

## SoS Pain Points

Dahmann, 2013. System of Systems Pain Points. INCOSE International Symposium.

1. Testing, Validation and Learning (How can SE approach SoS validation, testing and continuous learning in SoS?)  
2. Leadership (What are the roles and characteristics of effective SoS leaders?)  
3. Constituent Systems (What are effective approaches to integrating constituent systems?)  
4. Capabilities and Requirements (How can SE address SoS capabilities and requirements?)  
5. Autonomy, Interedependencies and Emergence (How can SE address the complexities of SoS interdependancies and emergent behaviours?)  
6. Principles (What are the key SoS thinking principles?)  
7. Authorities (What are the effective collaboration patterns in SoS?)  

### Authorities

SoS are comprised of multiple independent systems.
Each participating system has its own local "owner" with its stakeholders, users, business processes and development approach.
SE relies on cross cutting analysis and on composition and integration of constituent systems.
The focus is on creation of the incentives and development environment which allow thee systems to proceed to meet their own objectives while working cooperatively to support broader objectives.  

### Leadership

The challenge of leadership in the multiple organizational environment of an SoS.
Lack of structured control normally present in SE of sytems requires alternatives to provide coherence and direction, such as influence and incentives.

The organizational and technical complexity of SoS, with multiple independent stakeholders with their own interests, independence and cognitive biases, requires strong leadership to identify and assess technical options for SoS architecture, as well as options and strategies for coping with change/evolution.

SoS systems engineers to take a broad perspective and posses the ability to appreciate the perspectives of the constituent systems so they can organize and lead a cross organization SE team to find effective and acceptable solutions for development and evolution of cross cutting SoS capabilities while respecting the independent needs of the constituent system.

### CS Perspectives

## CyberPhysical Systems Framework

The first goal was to derive a unifying framework that covers the range of unique dimensions of CPS.  
The second goal is to populate a significant portion of the CPS Framework with detail.  

1. Identify domain: stakeholders may have domain-specific and cross-domain concerns.  
2. Identify cross-cutting concerns: stakeholders can have concerns that overlap or are instances of broader conceptual concerns.  
3. Analyze cross-cutting and produce aspects.  
4. Address concerns (aspects): within 3 fundamental facets of conceptualization, realization and assurance.  

![CPS Framework](fig/cps_framework.png)

Domain --> Aspects (Functional, Businness, Human, Trustworthness, Timing, Data, Boundaries, Composition, Lifecycle) --> Facets (Conceptualization, Realization and Assurance)

- Model : What things should be and what things are supposed to do.
- Instance : How things shold be made and operate
- Assurance : How to prove things actually work te way they should.

### Conventions

An _architecture framework_ consists of the "convetions, principles and practices for the description of architectures established within a specific domain of applicaiton and/or community of stakeholders"  

A _concern_ is an "interest in a system relevant to one or more of its stakeholders"  

An _architecture view_ consists of "work product expressing the architecture of a system from the perspective of specific system concern"  

An _architecture viewpoint_ consists of "work product establishing the conventions for the construction, interpretation and use of architecture views to frame specific system concerns"  

### Key Elements of CPS Framework

![CPS Framework Composition](./fig/csp_framework_composition.PNG)  

**Domain** -- the different application areas of CPS  
**Concerns** -- different stakeholders in unique and collective viewpoints, fundamental concept that drives the CPS framework  
**Properties** -- concrete assertions that address the concerns (requirements, design elements, tests, judgements)  
**Aspects** -- grouping of conceptually equivalent or related concerns  
**Facets** -- views of the CPS encompassing identified resposibilities in the systems engineering process

#### Steps

1. **Identify** concerns  
2. **Analyze** to produce aspects  
3. **Address** through activities and artifacts

The primary goal of the CPS Framework is to be _actionable_.  

A **fact**, therefore, is a collection of activities that produce artifacts taht are driven by **aspects** and their concerns for a CPS.  

![CPS Facets](./fig/csp_facets.PNG)

The analysis of CPS can be viewed from any aspect adn assembled by navigating one or more times through the aspects to obtain the complete view of the CPS.  

#### Properties

The _conceptualization facet_ comprises teh set of activities and artifacts that produce a model of CPS.  

A realied and assembled "CPS Model" is an instance of a CPS.  
The CPS model is the theoretical ideal of the CPS.  

The _realization facet_ and its activities strive to quantitatively satisfy the aspirational properties of the conceptualization facet.  

The _assurance facet_ then provides the assurance that the conceptualization was realized as _intetended_.  

Elements of the assurance case of a CPS consists of statements built from data produced during the activities of the first two facets of the framework.  
 
- claims  
- evidence  
- argumentation  
- estimate of confidence  

> "The [Evidence] is sufficient to conducted that the [Claims] are true based on the [Argumentation] with this [Estimate of Confidence]"  

This is an _assurance judgement_.
