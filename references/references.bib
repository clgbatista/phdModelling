	abstract = {This paper describes ongoing research efforts at the Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology (Skoltech) in collaboration with MIT to explore an innovation in space systems design: the Federated Satellite Systems (FSS) concept. FSS are conceived to increase the sustainability, cost effectiveness, robustness, and reliability of space-based assets, and hedge demand uncertainty while creating in-orbit markets of space resources. This abstract will present an overview of the current research efforts and will describe an application example of a possible implementation of FSS. The example in the paper demonstrates access time gains obtained by a radar altimeter mission relying on services delivered by an FSS infrastructure, and demonstrate feasibility of FSS in this context. The paper ends with conclusions formulating a research roadmap for the work on FSS development including stakeholders analysis, systems architecting, backbone technology development, and applications development.},

While similar concepts for large constellations already existed in the past, traditional satellite deployments hardly ever feature groups of more than 100 satellites. This trend towards considerably larger satellite numbers originates from nontraditional design and operations of spacecraft by non-traditional space companies. The evolution in the space sector, precipitated by new players, is often referred to as ‘‘Space 4.0” or ‘‘New Space”. It necessitates a rethinking of the way satellites and satellite constellations are planned, designed, and operated.

	abstract = {While monolithic satellite missions still pose significant advantages in terms of accuracy and operations, novel distributed architectures are promising improved flexibility, responsiveness, and adaptability to structural and functional changes. Large satellite swarms, opportunistic satellite networks or heterogeneous constellations hybridizing small-spacecraft nodes with highperformance satellites are becoming feasible and advantageous alternatives requiring the adoption of new operation paradigms that enhance their autonomy. While autonomy is a notion that is gaining acceptance in monolithic satellite missions, it can also be deemed an integral characteristic in Distributed Satellite Systems (DSS). In this context, this paper focuses on the motivations for system-level autonomy in DSS and justifies its need as an enabler of system qualities. Autonomy is also presented as a necessary feature to bring new distributed Earth observation functions (which require coordination and collaboration mechanisms) and to allow for novel structural functions (e.g., opportunistic coalitions, exchange of resources, or in-orbit data services). Mission Planning and Scheduling (MPS) frameworks are then presented as a key component to implement autonomous operations in satellite missions. An exhaustive knowledge classification explores the design aspects of MPS for DSS, and conceptually groups them into: components and organizational paradigms; problem modeling and representation; optimization techniques and metaheuristics; execution and runtime characteristics and the notions of tasks, resources, and constraints. This paper concludes by proposing future strands of work devoted to study the trade-offs of autonomy in large-scale, highly dynamic and heterogeneous networks through frameworks that consider some of the limitations of small spacecraft technologies.},

With the increase in this type of missions and with the need to connect and interrelate all the data that will be generated by these various missions as well as with the data acquired from ground and airborne sensors, there is a need to deﬁne more accurately all the terms used in relation to DSMs. This article presents a terminology including various deﬁnitions that describe DSMs and related concepts, their organization, physical conﬁguration, and functional conﬁguration, as well as a taxonomy from which DSMs can be designed.},

At the moment in fact, no cost-eﬀective infrastructure is available to withstand coordinated ﬂight of large ﬂeets of satellites. In order for large constellations to be sustainable, there is the need to eﬃciently integrate and use them in the current space framework. This review paper provides an overview of the available experience in constellation operations and statistical trends about upcoming constellations at the moment of writing. It highlights also the tools most often proposed in the analyzed works to overcome constellation management issues, such as applications of machine learning/artiﬁcial intelligence and resource/infrastructure sharing. As such, it is intended to be a useful resource for both identifying emerging trends in satellite constellations, and enabling technologies still requiring substantial development eﬀorts.},

FSS are networks of spacecraft trading previously inefficiently allocated and unused resources such as downlink bandwidth, storage, processing power, and instrument time. FSS holds the promise to enhance cost-effectiveness, performance and reliability of existing and future space missions, by networking different missions and effectively creating a pool of resources to exchange between participants in the federation. This paper introduces and describes the FSS paradigm, and develops an approach integrating mission analysis and economic assessments to evaluate the feasibility of the business case of FSS. The approach is demonstrated on a case study on opportunities enabled by FSS to enhance space exploration programs, with particular reference to the International Space Station. The application of the proposed methodology shows that the FSS concept is potentially able to create large commercial markets of in-space resources, by providing the technical platform to offer the opportunity for spacecraft to share or make use of unused resources within their orbital neighborhood. It is shown how the concept is beneficial to satellite operators, space agencies, and other stakeholders of the space industry to more flexibly interoperate space systems as a portfolio of assets, allowing unprecedented collaboration among heterogeneous types of missions.},

	abstract = {Cohesive Distributed Satellite Systems (CDSSs) is a key enabling technology for the future of remote sensing and communication missions. However, they have to meet strict synchronization requirements before their use is generalized. When clock or local oscillator signals are generated locally at each of the distributed nodes, achieving exact synchronization in absolute phase, frequency, and time is a complex problem. In addition, satellite systems have signiﬁcant resource constraints, especially for small satellites, which are envisioned to be part of the future CDSSs. Thus, the development of precise, robust, and resource-efﬁcient synchronization techniques is essential for the advancement of future CDSSs. In this context, this survey aims to summarize and categorize the most relevant results on synchronization techniques for Distributed Satellite Systems (DSSs). First, some important architecture and system concepts are deﬁned. Then, the synchronization methods reported in the literature are reviewed and categorized. This article also provides an extensive list of applications and examples of synchronization techniques for DSSs in addition to the most signiﬁcant advances in other operations closely related to synchronization, such as inter-satellite ranging and relative position. The survey also provides a discussion on emerging data-driven synchronization techniques based on Machine Learning (ML). Finally, a compilation of current research activities and potential research topics is proposed, identifying problems and open challenges that can be useful for researchers in the ﬁeld.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The success of satellites in orbit depends on the quality of the engineering processes adopted in the development cycle of the mission. The facilities and processes provided by Assembly, Integration and Testing (AIT) laboratories support the veriﬁcation and validation of satellite’ systems regarding their capacities to operating into space environmental conditions. Choose an ideal AIT organization to a particular satellite project requires knowing their processes and services provided. This paper presents a framework for evaluating the services for satellite AIT provided by an AIT organization. The framework, named PRONT-AIT, allows to assess the organization’s readiness based on both process areas and criteria of adherence to the stakeholder’s requirements. Methodology/approach – Inspired by the CMMI model, the framework was structured in process areas, covering management and technical processes of the AIT organization, that supports 5 levels of readiness. Each readiness level expresses the organization maturity in terms of the processes and practices established to provide the services required by a particular space project. Findings – The framework’s effectiveness is demonstrated through its use to assess the readiness of a particular AIT organization on meeting the speciﬁc requirements of two types of satellites: remote sensing and CubeSat satellites. The results reveal that the example organization readiness fully reached level 2 (Manageable Readiness) for remote sensing satellite and partially reached level 2 for CubeSat satellite. Originality/value – The framework has a good value to satellite project managers because it supports them on evaluating an AIT organization prior to contracting its services. Higher readiness level revealed by PRONT-AIT gives to the satellite project manager more conﬁdence on the AIT organization capacities. Thus, an AIT organization is not chosen solely on the basis of the facilities it offers and the cost of the services but also on the level of readiness revealed by this framework.},
